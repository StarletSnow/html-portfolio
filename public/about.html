<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Philip! Someone who’s curious about the world and deeply drawn to stories of people and places. 
  I’m passionate about healthcare, movement, and overall wellbeing, and I find joy in helping others feel seen and supported—especially within the LGBTQ+ community. 
  I manage our small family business and a side hustle in property rentals, but I’m also always exploring new paths—whether
  that’s studying something new, planning thoughtful travel, or dreaming up my next life chapter in Australia or New Zealand.</p>

<p>At my core, I care about people, community, and living with purpose (and a bit of fun and design flair, too).
</p>

<p>When I’m not working, you’ll find me playing tennis, mapping out thoughtful travel plans, or dressing up just because—it’s 
  how I stay inspired. I have a deep love for fashion, especially the artistry and philosophy behind Japanese brands like 
  Comme des Garçons, Yohji Yamamoto, and Issey Miyake. For me, style is personal—it’s how I express mood, memory, and meaning.</p>

<p>While I often think of myself as a jack of all trades and a master of none, I’ve come to embrace the process of exploring and evolving. 
  Lately, I’ve been diving into web development—curious, hopeful, and maybe just a little bit obsessed. 
  I’m learning not just to be good at something, but to be great—to find that one thing I can truly call my own</p>
